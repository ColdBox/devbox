<title>Clustering Overview</title>
<description>

<p>
Resin's clustering is designed to support a straight-forward
elastic-server private cloud: allowing servers to join and leave the
cluster while maintaining uptime and reliability without needing
configuration changes.
</p>

<p>To support the elastic-server cloud, Resin maintains the
following when servers are added and removed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data redundancy with a triad hub.</li>
<li>Application deployment through a clustered transactional
repository.</li>
<li>Distributed caching and store for both servlet sessions and jCache
caching.</li>
<li>Load balancing to the dynamic servers.</li>
<li>Distributed management, sensing, and health checks.</li>
<li>Elastic JMS message queues.</li>
</ul>

<s1 title="Overview">

<p>In Resin, clustering is always enabled. Even if you only have a single
server, that server belongs to its own cluster. As you add more
servers, the servers are added to the cluster, and automatically gain
benefits like clustered health monitoring, heartbeats, distributed
management, triple redundancy, and distributed deployment.</p>

<p>Resin clustering gives you:</p>

<ul>
<li>HTTP Load balancing and failover.</li>
<li>Dynamic servers: adding and removing servers dynamically.</li>
<li>Distributed deployment and versioning of applications.</li>
<li>A triple-redundant triad as the reliable cluster hub.</li>
<li>Heartbeat monitoring of all servers in the cluster.</li>
<li>Health sensors, metering and statistics across the cluster.</li>
<li>Clustered JMS queues and topics.</li>
<li>Distributed JMX management.</li>
<li>Clustered caches and distributed sessions.</li>
</ul>

<p>While most web applications start their life-cycle being deployed
to a single server, it eventually becomes necessary to add servers
either for performance or for increased reliability. The single-server
deployment model is very simple and
certainly the one developers are most familiar with since single
servers are usually used for development and testing (especially on a
developer's local machine). As the usage of a web application grows
beyond moderate numbers, the hardware limitations of a single machine
simply is not enough (the problem is even more acute when you have
more than one high-use application deployed to a single machine). The
physical hardware limits of a server usually manifest themselves as
chronic high CPU and memory usage despite reasonable performance
tuning and hardware upgrades.</p>

<p>Server <em>load-balancing</em> solves the scaling problem by letting you
deploy a single web application to more than one physical
machine. These machines can then be used to share the web application
traffic, reducing the total workload on a single machine and providing
better performance from the perspective of the user. We'll discuss
Resin's load-balancing capabilities in greater detail shortly, but
load-balancing is usually achieved by transparently redirecting
network traffic across multiple machines at the systems level via a
hardware or software load-balancer (both of which Resin supports).
Load-balancing also increases the reliability/up-time of a system
because even if one or more servers go down or are brought down for
maintenance, other servers can still continue to handle traffic. With
a single server application, any down-time is directly visible to the
user, drastically decreasing reliability.  </p>

<p>If your application runs on multiple servers,
Resin's <em>clustered deployment</em> helps you updating new versions
of your application to all servers, and verify that all servers in the
cluster are running the same version. When you deploy a new version,
Resin ensures that all servers have an identical copy, validates the
application, and then deploys it consistently.  The clustered
deployment is reliable across failures because its built on a
transactional version control system (Git).  After a new server starts
or a failed server restarts, it checks with the redundant triad for
the latest application version, copying it as necessary and deploying it.
</p>

<p>If web applications were entirely stateless, load-balancing alone
would be sufficient in meeting all application server scalability
needs. In reality, most web applications are relatively heavily
stateful. Even very simple web applications use the HTTP session to
keep track of current login, shopping-cart-like functionality and so
on.  Component oriented web frameworks like JSF and Wicket in
particular tend to heavily use the HTTP session to achieve greater
development abstraction. Maintaining application state is also very
natural for the CDI (Resin CanDI) and Seam programming models
with stateful, conversational components. When web applications are
load-balanced, application state must somehow be shared across
application servers.  While in most cases you will likely be using a
<i>sticky session</i> (discussed in detail shortly) to pin a session
to a single server, sharing state is still important for
<i>fail-over</i>. Fail-over is the process of seamlessly transferring
over an existing session from one server to another when a
load-balanced server fails or is taken down (probably for
upgrade). Without fail-over, the user would lose a session when a
load-balanced server experiences down-time. In order for fail-over to
work, application state must be synchronized or replicated in real
time across a set of load-balanced servers. This state synchronization
or replication process is generally known as <i>clustering</i>. In a
similar vein, the set of synchronized, load-balanced servers are
collectively called a <i>cluster</i>. Resin supports robust clustering
including persistent sessions, distributed sessions and dynamically
adding/removing servers from a cluster (elastic/cloud computing).
</p>

<p>Based on the infrastructure required to support load-balancing,
fail-over and clustering, Resin also has support for a distributed
caching API, clustered application deployment as well as tools for
administering the cluster.</p>


</s1>

<s1 title="Dynamic Servers">

<p>Resin lets you add and remove servers dynamically to the system, and
automatically adjusts the cluster to manage those servers. When you add
a new server, Resin:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Pushes the latest deployed applications to the new server.</li>
<li>Replicates distributed caching data if the new server is a triad.</li>
<li>Updates the load balancer to send requests to the new server.</li>
<li>Creates clients for the JMS queues.</li>
<li>Updates the health system to monitor and administer the new server.</li>
</ul>

<s2 title="Starting an dynamic server">

<p>The new server requires a copy of the site's resin.xml, which must have
at least one server configured, because the server needs the IP address of
the core servers.</p>

<p>The main operation is a "-join-cluster app-tier" which tells the
new server which cluster to join.</p>

<example title="Example: minimal command-line for dynamic server">
unix> bin/resin.sh -join-cluster app-tier start \
          -user my-admin -password my-password
</example>

<p>As usual, you can name the server with "-server my-name". By default, one
is generated automatically.</p>

<p>After the server shuts down, the cluster will remember it for 15 minutes,
giving the server time to restart before removing it from the cluster.</p>

</s2>

</s1>

<s1 title="Deploying Applications to a Cluster">

<p>The simplest mechanism for doing deployment in a clustered
environment is to copy files to each server's deployment
directory. The biggest issue with this approach is that it is very
difficult to synchronize deployment across the cluster and it often
results in some down-time. Resin clustered deployment is designed to
solve this problem. Resin has ANT and Maven based APIs to deploy to a
cluster in an automated fashion. These features work much like session
clustering in that applications are automatically replicated across
the cluster. Because Resin cluster deployment is based on Git, it also
allows for application versioning and staging across the cluster.
</p>

<p>Although the upload and copy of application archives is common for
single servers, it becomes more difficult to manage as your site
scales to multiple servers. Along with the mechanics of copying the
same file many times, you also need to consider the synchronization of
applications across all the servers, making sure that each server has
a complete, consistent copy. The benefits of using Resin's clustered
deployment include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Verify complete upload by secure digest before deployment begins.</li>
<li>Verify all servers receive the same copy of the application.</li>
<li>Versioned deployment, including transparent user upgrades.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because each organization has different deployment strategies,
Resin provides several deployment techniques to match
your internal deployment strategy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upload and copy .war files individually.</li>
<li>Use from command-line with "deploy" command.</li>
<li>Use /resin-admin deploy form.</li>
<li>Use ant script with Resin's deployment plugin.</li>
<li>Use maven script with Resin's deployment plugin.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example, the command-line deployment of a .war file to a
running Resin instance looks like the following:</p>

<example>
unix> bin/resin.sh deploy test.war -user my-user -password my-pass

Deployed production/webapp/default/test from /home/caucho/ws/test.war
  to http://192.168.1.10:8080/hmtp
</example>

<p>In order to use Resin clustered deployment, you must first enable
remote deployment on the server, which is disabled by default for security.
You do this using the following Resin configuration: </p>

<example title="Enabling Resin Clustered Deployment">
&lt;resin xmlns="http://caucho.com/ns/resin"
       xmlns:resin="urn:java:com.caucho.resin">
  &lt;cluster id="app-tier">

    &lt;resin:AdminAuthenticator password-digest="none">
      &lt;resin:user name="my-user" password="my-pass"/>
    &lt;/resin:AdminAuthenticator>
    
    &lt;resin:RemoteAdminService/>
    &lt;resin:DeployService/>
  ...
  &lt;/cluster>
&lt;/resin>
</example>

<p>In the example above, both the remote admin service and the
deployment service is enabled. Note, the admin authenticator must be
enabled for any remote administration and deployment for obvious
security reasons. To keep things simple, we used a clear-text password
above, but you should likely use a password hash instead.  </p>

<p>The output exposes a few important details about the underlying
remote deployment implementation for Resin that you should
understand. Remote deployment for Resin uses Git under the hood. In
case you are not familiar with it, Git is a newish version control
system similar to Subversion. A great feature of Git is that it is
really clever about avoiding redundancy and synchronizing data across
a network. Under the hood, Resin stores deployed files as nodes in Git
with tags representing the type of file, development stage, virtual
host, web application context root name and version. The format used
is this: </p>

<example>
stage/type/host/webapp[-version]
</example>

<p>In the example, all web applications are stored under
<var>webapp</var>, we didn't specify a stage or virtual host in the
Ant task so <var>default</var> is used, the web application root is
foo and no version is used since one was not specified.  This format
is key to the versioning and staging featured we will discuss shortly.
</p>

<p>As soon as your web application is uploaded to the Resin
deployment repository, it is propagated to all the servers in the
cluster - including any dynamic servers that are added to the cluster
at a later point in time after initial propagation happens.</p>

<figure src="deployment.png" alt="Deployment unit -> Resin/Git(Instance1 <-> Instance2 <-> Instance 3)"/>

<p>When you deploy an application, it's always a good idea to check that
all servers in the cluster have received the correct web-app. Because
Resin's deployment is based on a transactional version-control system,
you can compare the exact version across all servers in the cluster
using the /resin-admin web-app page.</p>

<p>The following screenshot shows the /hello1 webapp deployed across the
cluster using a .war deployment in the webapps/ directory. Each
version (date) is in green to indicate that the hash validation matches
for each server. If one server had a different content, the date would be
marked with a red 'x'.</p>

<figure src="webapp-deploy.png" alt="/foo,Active,Red X,Timestamp  /hello1,Active,Red X,Timestamp  Deploy server list"/>

</s1>

<s1 title="HTTP Load Balancing and Failover">

<p>Once your traffic increases beyond the capacity of a single
application server, your site needs to add a HTTP load balancer as
well as the second application server. Your system is now a two
tier system: an app-tier with your program and a web-tier for
HTTP load-balancing and HTTP proxy caching. Since the load-balancing
web-tier is focusing on
HTTP and proxy caching, you can usually handle many app-tier servers
with a single web-tier load balancer. Although the largest sites will
pay for an expensive hardware load balancer, medium and small sites
can use Resin's built-in load-balancer as a cost-effective and
efficient way to scale a moderate number of servers, while gaining the
performance advantage of Resin's HTTP proxy caching.</p>

<p>A load balanced system has three main requirements: define the servers
to use as the application-tier, define the servers in the web-tier,
and select which requests are forwarded (proxied) to the backend
app-tier servers. Since Resin's clustering configuration already
defines the servers in a cluster, the only additional configuration
is to use the &lt;resin:LoadBalance> tag to forward request to the backend.</p>

<figure src="cluster-load-balance.png" alt="web-tier(80:web-a) -> app-tier(6800:app-a(foo.com,bar.com), 6801:app-b(foo.com,bar.com))" />

<p>Dispatching requests with load balancing in Resin is accomplished through
the <a href="http-rewrite-ref.xtp">&lt;resin:LoadBalance></a> tag
placed on a cluster.  In effect, the <a
href="http-rewrite-ref.xtp">&lt;resin:LoadBalance></a> tag turns a set
of servers in a cluster into a software load-balancer. This makes a
lot of sense in light of the fact that as the traffic on your
application requires multiple servers, your site will naturally be
split into two tiers: an application server tier for running your web
applications and a web/HTTP server tier talking to end-point browsers,
caching static/non-static content, and distributing load across
servers in the application server tier.  </p>

<p>The best way to understand how this works is through a simple
example configuration.  The following resin.xml configuration shows
servers split into two clusters: a web-tier for load balancing and
HTTP, and an app-tier to process the application:</p>

<example title="Example: resin.xml for Load-Balancing">
&lt;resin xmlns="http://caucho.com/ns/resin"
          xmlns:resin="urn:java:com.caucho.resin"&gt;

  &lt;cluster-default>
    &lt;resin:import path="${__DIR__}/app-default.xml"/>
  &lt;/cluster-default>

  &lt;cluster id="app-tier"&gt;
    &lt;server id="app-a" address="192.168.0.10" port="6800"/&gt;
    &lt;server id="app-b" address="192.168.0.11" port="6800"/&gt;

    &lt;host id=""&gt;
      &lt;web-app id="" root-directory="/var/resin/htdocs"/>
    &lt;/host&gt;
  &lt;/cluster&gt;

  &lt;cluster id="web-tier"&gt;
    &lt;server id="web-a" address="192.168.0.1" port="6800"&gt;
      &lt;http port="80"/&gt;
    &lt;/server>

    &lt;proxy-cache memory-size="256M"/&gt;

    &lt;host id=""&gt;
    
      &lt;resin:LoadBalance regexp="" cluster="app-tier"/>

    &lt;/host&gt;
  &lt;/cluster&gt;

&lt;/resin&gt;
</example>

<p>In the configuration above, the <var>web-tier</var> cluster server
load balances across the <var>app-tier</var> cluster servers because
of the <var>cluster</var> attribute specified in the
&lt;resin:LoadBalance> tag.  The &lt;cache> tag enables proxy caching
at the web tier. The web-tier forwards requests evenly and skips any
app-tier server that's down for maintenance/upgrade or restarting due
to a crash. The load balancer also steers traffic from a single
session to the same app-tier server (a.k.a sticky sessions), improving
caching and session performance.  </p>

<p>Each app-tier server produces the same application because they
have the same virtual hosts, web-applications and Servlets, and use
the same resin.xml.  Adding a new machine just requires adding a new
&lt;server> tag to the cluster. Each server has a unique name like
"app-b" and a TCP cluster-port consisting of an &lt;IP,port>, so the
other servers can communicate with it. Although you can start multiple
Resin servers on the same machine, TCP requires the &lt;IP,port> to be
unique, so you might need to assign unique ports like 6801, 6802 for
servers on the same machine. On different machines, you'll use unique
IP addresses. Because the cluster-port is for Resin servers to
communicate with each other, they'll typically be private IP addresses
like 192.168.1.10 and not public IP addresses. In particular, the load
balancer on the web-tier uses the cluster-port of the app-tier to
forward HTTP requests.</p>

<p>All three servers will use the same resin.xml, which makes
managing multiple server configurations pretty easy. The servers are
named by the server <var>id</var> attribute, which must be unique,
just as the &lt;IP,port>. When you start a Resin instance, you'll use
the server-id as part of the command line: </p>


<example title="Starting Servers">
192.168.0.10> bin/resin.sh -server app-a start
192.168.0.11> bin/resin.sh -server app-b start
192.168.0.1> bin/resin.sh -server web-a start
</example>

<p>Since Resin lets you start multiple servers on the same machine, a
small site might start the web-tier server and one of the app-tier
servers on one machine, and start the second server on a second
machine. You can even start all three servers on the same machine,
increasing reliability and easing maintenance, without addressing the
additional load (although it will still be problematic if the physical
machine itself and not just the JVM crashes). If you do put multiple
servers on the same machine, remember to change the <var>port</var> to
something like 6801, etc so the TCP binds do not conflict.  </p>

<p>In the <a href="resin-admin.xtp">/resin-admin</a> management page,
you can manage all three servers at once, gathering statistics/load
and watching for any errors.  When setting up /resin-admin on a
web-tier server, you'll want to remember to add a separate
&lt;web-app> for resin-admin to make sure the &lt;rewrite-dispatch>
doesn't inadvertantly send the management request to the app-tier.
</p>

<s2 title="Sticky/Persistent Sessions">

<p>To understand what sticky sessions are and why they are important,
it is easiest to see what will happen without them. Let us take our
previous example and assume that the web tier distributes sessions
across the application tier in a totally random fashion. Recall that
while Resin can replicate the HTTP session across the cluster, it does
not do so by default. Now lets assume that the first request to the
web application resolves to app-a and results in the login being
stored in the session.  If the load-balancer distributes sessions
randomly, there is no guarantee that the next request will come to
app-a. If it goes to app-b, that server instance will have no
knowledge of the login and will start a fresh session, forcing the
user to login again. The same issue would be repeated as the user
continues to use the application from in what their view should be a
single session with well-defined state, making for a pretty confusing
experience with application state randomly getting lost!  </p>

<p>One way to solve this issue would be to fully synchronize the
session across the load-balanced servers. Resin does support this
through its clustering features (which is discussed in detail in the
following sections). The problem is that the cost of continuously
doing this synchronization across the entire cluster is very high and
relatively unnecessary. This is where sticky sessions come in. With
sticky sessions, the load-balancer makes sure that once a session is
started, any subsequent requests from the client go to the same server
where the session resides. By default, the Resin load-balancer
enforces sticky sessions, so you don't really need to do anything to
enable it.  </p>

<p>Resin accomplishes this by encoding the session cookie with the
host name that started the session. Using our example, the hosts would
generate cookies like this: </p>

<deftable>
<tr>
  <th>Index</th>
  <th>Cookie Prefix</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td><var>a</var>xxx</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2</td>
  <td><var>b</var>xxx</td>
</tr>
</deftable>

<p>On the web-tier, Resin decoded the session cookie and sends it
to the appropriate server. So <var>baaX8ZwooOz</var> will go to
app-b. If app-b fails or is down for maintenance, Resin will send the
request a backup server calculated from the session id, in this
case app-a. Because the session is not clustered, the user will
lose the session but they won't see a connection failure (to see how
to avoid losing the session, check out the following section on
clustering).  </p>

</s2>

<s2 title="Manually Choosing a Server">

<p>For testing purposes you might want to send requests to a specific
servers in the app-tier manually. You can easily do this since the
web-tier uses the value of the <var>jsessionid</var> to maintain
sticky sessions. You can include an explicit <var>jsessionid</var> to
force the web-tier to use a particular server in the app-tier.  </p>

<p>Since Resin uses the first character of the <var>jsessionid</var>
to identify the server to use, starting with 'a' will resolve the
request to app-a.  If www.example.com resolves to your web-tier, then
you can use values like this for testing: </p>

<ol>
<li>http://www.example.com/test-servlet;jsessionid=aaaXXXXX</li>
<li>http://www.example.com/test-servlet;jsessionid=baaXXXXX</li>
<li>http://www.example.com/test-servlet;jsessionid=caaXXXXX</li>
<li>http://www.example.com/test-servlet;jsessionid=daaXXXXX</li>
<li>http://www.example.com/test-servlet;jsessionid=eaaXXXXX</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also use this fact to configure an external sticky
load-balancer (likely a high-performance hardware load-balancer) and
eliminate the web tier altogether. In this case, this is how the Resin
configuration might look like: </p>

<example title="resin.xml with Hardware Load-Balancer">
&lt;resin xmlns="http://caucho.com/ns/resin"&gt;
  &lt;cluster id="app-tier"&gt;
    &lt;server-default>
      &lt;http port='80'/&gt;
    &lt;/server-default>

    &lt;server id='app-a' address='192.168.0.1' port="6800"/&gt;
    &lt;server id='app-b' address='192.168.0.2' port="6800"/&gt;
    &lt;server id='app-c' address='192.168.0.3' port="6800"/&gt;

  &lt;/cluster&gt;
&lt;/resin&gt;
</example>

<p>Each server will be started as <var>-server a</var>, <var>-server
b</var>, etc to grab its specific configuration.  </p>

</s2>

<s2 title="Socket Pooling, Timeouts, and Failover">

<p>For efficiency, Resin's load balancer manages a pool of sockets
connecting to the app-tier servers. If Resin forwards a new request to
an app-tier server and it has an idle socket available in the pool, it
will reuse that socket, improving performance and minimizing network
load. Resin uses a set of timeout values to manage the socket pool and
to handle any failures or freezes of the backend servers. The
following diagram illustrates the main timeout values:</p>

<figure src="load-balance-idle-time.png" alt="web-a:connecty-timeout,app-a:socket-timeout,web-a:recover-time,app-a:keepalive-timeout,web-a:idle-time"/>
<ul>
<li><b>load-balance-connect-timeout</b>: the load balancer timeout
for the <code>connect()</code> system call to complete to
the app-tier (5s).</li>
<li><b>load-balance-idle-time</b>: load balancer timeout
for an idle socket before closing it automatically (5s).</li>
<li><b>load-balance-recover-time</b>: the load balancer connection failure wait
time before trying a new connection (15s).</li>
<li><b>load-balance-socket-timeout</b>: the load balancer
timeout for a valid request to complete (665s).</li>
<li><b>keepalive-timeout</b>: the app-tier timeout for a keepalive
connection (15s)</li>
<li><b>socket-timeout</b>: the app-tier timeout for a read or
write (65s)</li>
</ul>

<p>When an app-tier server is down due to maintenance or a crash,
Resin will use the <b>load-balance-recover-time</b> as a delay before
retrying the downed server.  With the failover and recover timeout,
the load balancer reduces the cost of a failed server to almost no
time at all.  Every recover-time, Resin will try a new connection and
wait for <b>load-balance-connect-timeout</b> for the server to
respond.  At most, one request every 15 seconds might wait an extra 5
seconds to connect to the backend server.  All other requests will
automatically go to the other servers.</p>

<p>The socket-timeout values tell Resin when a socket connection is
dead and should be dropped.  The web-tier timeout
<b>load-balance-socket-timeout</b> is much larger than the app-tier
timeout <b>socket-timeout</b> because the web-tier needs to wait for
the application to generate the response.  If your application has
some very slow pages, like a complicated nightly report, you may need
to increase the <b>load-balance-socket-timeout</b> to avoid the
web-tier disconnecting it.</p>

<p>Likewise, the <b>load-balance-idle-time</b> and
<b>keepalive-timeout</b> are a matching pair for the socket idle pool.
The idle-time tells the web-tier how long it can keep an idle socket
before closing it.  The keepalive-timeout tells the app-tier how long
it should listen for new requests on the socket.  The
<b>keepalive-timeout</b> must be significantly larger than the
<b>load-balance-idle-time</b> so the app-tier doesn't close its
sockets too soon.  The keepalive timeout can be large since the
app-tier can use the <a
href="http-server-ref.xtp">keepalive-select</a> manager to efficiently
wait for many connections at once.</p> </s2>

<s2 title="resin:LoadBalance Dispatching">

<p>&lt;resin:LoadBalance> is part of Resin's <a
href="http-rewrite.xtp">rewrite</a> capabilities, Resin's equivalent
of the Apache mod_rewrite module, providing powerful and detailed URL
matching and decoding. More sophisticated sites might load-balance
based on the virtual host or URL using multiple &lt;resin:LoadBalance>
tags.</p>

<p>In most cases, the web-tier will dispatch everything to the
app-tier servers.  Because of Resin's <a
href="http-proxy-cache.xtp">proxy
cache</a>, the web-tier servers will serve static pages as
fast as if they were local pages.</p>

<p>In some cases, though, it may be important to send different
requests to different backend clusters. The <a
href="http://caucho.com/resin-javadoc/com/caucho/rewrite/LoadBalance.html">&lt;resin:LoadBalance></a>
tag can choose clusters based on URL patterns when such capabilities
are needed.</p>

<p>The following <a href="http-rewrite.xtp">rewrite</a> example
keeps all *.png, *.gif, and *.jpg files on the web-tier, sends
everything in /foo/* to the foo-tier cluster, everything in /bar/* to
the bar-tier cluster, and keeps anything else on the web-tier.</p>

<example title="Example: resin.xml Split Dispatching">
&lt;resin xmlns="http://caucho.com/ns/resin"
          xmlns:resin="urn:java:com.caucho.resin">

        &lt;resin:LoadBalance regexp="^/foo" cluster="foo-tier"/>

        &lt;resin:LoadBalance regexp="^/bar" cluster="bar-tier"/>

      &lt;/web-app>
    &lt;/host>
  &lt;/cluster>

  &lt;cluster id="foo-tier">
    ...
  &lt;/cluster>

  &lt;cluster id="bar-tier">
    ...
  &lt;/cluster>
&lt;/resin>

<s1 title="Triple Redundant Clustering (the Triad)">

<p>After many years of developing Resin's distributed clustering for a
wide variety of user configurations, we refined our clustering network to a
hub-and-spoke model using a triple-redundant triad of servers as the
cluster hub. The triad model provides interlocking benefits for the
dynamically scaling server configurations people are using.</p>

<ul>
<li>When you bring down one server for maintenance, the triple
redundancy continues to maintain reliability.</li>
<li>You can add and remove dynamic servers safely without
affecting the redundant state.</li>
<li>Your network processing will be load-balanced across three
servers, eliminating a single point of failure.</li>
<li>Your servers will scale evenly across the cluster pod because each
new server only needs to speak to the triad, not all servers.</li>
<li>Your large site can split the cluster into independent "pods" of less
than 64-servers to maintain scalability.</li>
</ul>

<s2 title="Cluster Heartbeat">

<p>As part of Resin's health check system, the cluster continually
checks that all servers are alive and responding properly.  Every
60 seconds, each server sends a heartbeat to the triad, and each triad
server sends a heartbeat to all the other servers.</p>

<p>When a server failure is detected, Resin immediately detects the
failure, logging it for an administrator's analysis and internally
prepares to failover to backup servers for any messaging for
distributed storage like the clustered sessions and the
clustered deployment.</p>

<p>When the server comes back up, the heartbeat is reestablished and
any missing data is recovered.</p>

</s2>

</s1>

<s1 title="Clustered Sessions">

<p>Because load balancing, maintenance and failover should be
invisible to your users, Resin can replicate user's session data across
the cluster. When the load-balancer fails over a request to a backup
server, or when you dynamically remove a server, the backup can grab
the session and continue processing. From the user's perspective,
nothing has changed. To make this process fast and reliable, Resin
uses the triad servers as a triplicate backup for the user's session.</p>

<p>
The following is a simple example of how to enable clustering on Resin:
</p>

<example title="Example: resin-web.xml enabling clustered sessions">
&lt;web-app xmlns="http://caucho.com/ns/resin"&gt;
  &lt;session-config&gt;
    &lt;use-persistent-store="true"/&gt;
  &lt;/session-config&gt;
&lt;/web-app&gt;
</example>

<p>The <a
href="deploy-ref.xtp#session-config">&lt;use-persistent-store&gt;</a>
tag under <a
href="deploy-ref.xtp#session-config">&lt;session-config&gt;</a> is
used to enable clustering. Note, clustering is enabled on a
per-web-application basis because not all web applications under a host
need be clustered. If you want to cluster all web applications under a
host, you can place &lt;use-persistent-store&gt; under <a
href="deploy-ref.xtp#web-app-default">&lt;web-app-default&gt;</a>. The
following example shows how you can do this: </p>

<example title="Example: Clustering for All Web Applications">
&lt;resin xmlns="http://caucho.com/ns/resin"&gt;
  &lt;cluster&gt;
    &lt;server id="a" address="192.168.0.1" port="6800"/&gt;
    &lt;server id="b" address="192.168.0.2" port="6800"/&gt;

    &lt;web-app-default&gt;
      &lt;session-config use-persistent-store="true"/&gt;
    &lt;/web-app-default&gt;
  &lt;/cluster&gt;
&lt;/resin&gt;
</example>

<p>The above example also shows how you can override the clustering
behaviour for Resin.  By default, Resin uses a triad based replication
with all three triad servers backing up the data server. THe
&lt;persistent-store type="cluster"&gt; has a number of other
attributes: </p>

<deftable title="cluster store attributes">
<tr>
  <th>Attribute</th>
  <th>Description</th>
  <th>Default</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>always-save</td>
  <td>Always save the value</td>
  <td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>max-idle-time</td>
  <td>How long idle objects are stored (session-timeout will invalidate
items earlier)</td>
  <td>24h</td>
</tr>
</deftable>

<p>The cluster store is valuable for single-server configurations,
because Resin stores a copy of the session data on disk, allowing
for recovery after system restart. This
is basically identical to the file persistence feature discussed
below.  </p>

<s2 title="always-save-session">

<p>Resin's distributed sessions need to know when a session has
changed in order to save/synchronize the new session value. Although
Resin does detect when an application calls
<var>HttpSession.setAttribute</var>, it can't tell if an internal
session value has changed. The following Counter class shows the
issue:</p>

<example title="Counter.java">
package test;

public class Counter implements java.io.Serializable {
  private int _count;

  public int nextCount() { return _count++; }
}
</example>

<p>Assuming a copy of the Counter is saved as a session attribute,
Resin doesn't know if the application has called
<var>nextCount</var>. If it can't detect a change, Resin will not
backup/synchronize the new session, unless
<var>always-save-session</var> is set on the
&lt;session-config&gt;. When <var>always-save-session</var> is true,
Resin will back up the entire session at the end of every
request. Otherwise, a session is only changed when a change is
detected.</p>

<example>
...
&lt;web-app id="/foo"&gt;
...
&lt;session-config&gt;
  &lt;use-persistent-store/&gt;
  &lt;always-save-session/&gt;
&lt;/session-config&gt;
...
&lt;/web-app&gt;
</example>
</s2>

<s2 title="Serialization">

<p>Resin's distributed sessions relies on Hessian serialization to
save and restore sessions. Application objects must implement
<var>java.io.Serializable</var> for distributed sessions to work.</p>

</s2>

<s2 title="No Distributed Locking">

<p>Resin's clustering does not lock sessions for replication. For
browser-based sessions, only one request will typically execute at a
time. Because browser sessions have no concurrency, there's really no
need for distributed locking. However, it's a good idea to be aware of
the lack of distributed locking in Resin clustering.</p>

<s1 title="Distributed Caching">

<p>Distributed caching is a very useful technique for reducing
database load and increasing application performance. Resin provides a
very simple JSR-107 JCache based distributed caching API. Distributed
caching in Resin basically leverages the underlying infrastructure
used to support load balancing, clustering and session/state
replication. Note, since Resin clustering is not transactional, Resin
distributed caching is also not transactional and does not use
locking.  </p>

<p>
The first step to using Resin distributed caching is to configure a cache. 
You configure a named distributed cache at the web application level like this:
</p>
<!-- XXX: Is this accurate? Why can't you configure a cache at the cluster level? -->
<example title="Configuring Resin Distributed Cache">
&lt;resin xmlns="http://caucho.com/ns/resin"
       xmlns:cluster="urn:java:com.caucho.distcache">
  &lt;cluster id="">
    &lt;host id="">
      &lt;web-app id="">
        &lt;cluster:ClusterCache>
          &lt;cluster:name>test&lt;/cluster:name>
        &lt;/cluster:ClusterCache> 
      &lt;/web-app>
    &lt;/host>
  &lt;/cluster>
&lt;/resin>
</example>

<p>
You may then inject the cache through CDI and use it in your application via the 
JCache API:
</p>

<!-- XXX: Why is the name not being used in injection? -->
<example title="Using Resin Distributed Cache">
import javax.cache.*;
...
@Inject
private Cache cache;
...
if (cache.get("discount_rate") != null) {
  cache.put("discount_rate", discountRate);
}
</example>
