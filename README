This is the README file for the ColdBox DevBox
==============================================

The ColdBox DevBox is a complete development environment for your ColdBox needs.
It includes a fully configured J2EE application server, Resin 4 with Railo,
the open source CFML engine, deployed for you.  We have also installed a few nice 
plugins into your Railo Administrator for memory monitoring, scope monitor and more.

To start the DevBox:
Windows  
- Run start.exe or the setup.exe to setup with Apache or IIS

*nix/Mac 
- Make sure the files are executable, if not run: chmod -R 777 * to make files executable
- Run start.sh in the command line or in Mac run the start.app

The webroot path for your DevBox is:
/coldbox-devbox/webapps/ROOT

The ColdBox bundle has been deployed for you:
/coldbox-devbox/webapps/ROOT/coldbox

The web address for your DevBox is:
http://localhost:8081/index.cfm

The DevBox has some more applications deployed for you:
ColdBox Dashboard - http://localhost:8081/coldbox/dashboard
ColdBox API Docs - http://localhost:8081/coldbox-docs
ColdBox Samples Gallery - http://localhost:8081/coldbox/samples
ColdBox Application Templates - http://localhost:8081/coldbox/ApplicationTemplates
Coldbox Platform Utilities - /webapps/ROOT/coldbox-utilities

The web address for the Railo Administrator console is:
http://localhost:8081/railo-context/admin/server.cfm

The password for the Railo administrators are: coldbox

RESIN Documentation
==============================================
The documentation included with Resin is in XTP format starting at

I) Licensing/Support
--------------------

For pricing and licensing information for Resin 4.0 Professional,
see http://www.caucho.com/resin/sales.  Resin Professional contains
additional performance and reliability features beyond the Resin Open
Source version.

Resin 4.0 Open Source is released under the GPL.

Resin licenses do not include technical support. However, we offer several
technical support options to fit your support and budget needs.

II) Preconditions
-----------------

  1) Resin needs a Java JDK before it can run.  Resin 4.0 works with 
     JDK 1.6 or greater.

     Some locations for JDKs include:

     Oracle:
       http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

  2) On Windows, you'll need an unzip tool available at http://www.winzip.com
 
  3) A HTML 5 browser is needed for some features of the /resin-admin tool.

III) Getting Started
--------------------

The included HTTP/1.1 server makes it easy to evaluate Resin, JSP
and servlets.  Just start it up.  The default configuration
file is found in resin-4.0.x/conf/resin.xml.

  1) On Unix, you'll want to build the JNI libraries:

     resin-4.0.x> ./configure --prefix=`pwd`
     resin-4.0.x> make
     resin-4.0.x> make install

  2) To start the server:

       unix> bin/resin.sh start

     or

       C:\> java -jar lib/resin.jar start

     The server listens to port 8081.  Port 8081 is the default specified
     in the configuration file resin-4.0.x/conf/resin.xml

     Log files are in resin-4.0.x/log

  3) Usually, Resin can find the JDK, but you may need to set JAVA_HOME in some
     configurations. 

     Starting Resin with -verbose is a great way to see what environment
     Resin is running.

  4) Browse http://localhost:8081 or equivalently http://127.0.0.1:8081.

  5) Go through the documentation at http://localhost:8081/resin-doc


IV) Application Deployment
--------------------------

  1) You can use the command-line to deploy a .war file:
  
       unix> bin/resin.sh deploy foo.war

  2) You can also copy the war file to the webapps directory.

     To deploy a war file, place the file in resin-4.0.x/webapps/foo.war
     Resin will expand the war file, and the application will be available
     with the url http://localhost:8081/foo/

  3) Resin supports the development of applications without requiring a war
     file deployment.  Create a directory resin-4.0.x/webapps/bar to
     correspond to url http://localhost:8081/bar/.  Java source files
     placed in resin-4.0.x/webapps/bar/WEB-INF/classes/ are automatically 
     compiled by Resin.

     resin-4.0.x/webapps/bar/index.jsp
       --> http://localhost:8081/bar/
       --> http://localhost:8081/bar/index.jsp

    resin-4.0.x/webapps/bar/WEB-INF/web.xml
       -- servlet/jsp configuration file

    resin-4.0.x/webapps/bar/WEB-INF/resin-web.xml
       -- Resin specific configuration

    resin-4.0.x/webapps/bar/WEB-INF/classes/example/HelloServlet.java
       -- java source file, automatically compiled by Resin
     
  4) For PHP, create test.php in resin-4.0.x/webapps/ROOT/test.php and browse
     http://localhost:8081/test.php.


IV) PDF Reports
---------------

  With Resin-Pro, you can get a PDF snapshot report of the server with the
  command-line:

    unix> bin/resin.sh pdf-report

  You can also get a watchdog restart report with the -watchdog option
  
    unix> bin/resin.sh pdf-report -watchdog

    
V) /resin-admin browser-based administration
--------------------------------------------

  An administration application is available at

     http://localhost:8081/resin-admin

  Instructions are provided for setting a password.
