This is Oscar Arevalo's & Luis Majano's ColdBox RSS Reader.

Requirements
- ColdBox Framework
- MySQL, MSSQL
- ColdSpring Framework


Installation Procedures.
1 MySQL) Open the coldboxreader.sql file and import it in to your MySQL schema. You can use the default
   schema, coldboxreader, or you can import it to wherever you want. Just make sure your datasource
   element in your config/config.xml.cfm points to the correct schema. Open the config/config.xml.cfm and
  change the dbtype element to "MYSQL".

1 MSSQL) Open the mssql_dbscript.sql to create the coldboxreader database and structure. Once the structure
  has been created, then run the mssql_datascript.sql to insert the data. Open the config/config.xml.cfm and
  change the dbtype element to "MSSQL".

2) Create the datasource in your coldfusion administrator as coldboxreader, with your login and password.
   You can rename the datasource to whatever you want as long as you change it in the config/config.xml.cfm
   You can also put your login and password there.
3) Open the application and enjoy. The default user created for you has the following login information:

User: admin
Password: coldbox

You cannot change your passwords yet, so if you don't want that user, then delete him and create yours.
All passwords are saved as hash strings using default coldfusion hash().
