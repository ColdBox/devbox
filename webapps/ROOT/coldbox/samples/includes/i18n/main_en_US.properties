aboutcoldbox=ColdBox is a proven event-driven CFC based ColdFusion Framework, specifically designed for high availability web applications. The purpose behind ColdBox was to create a fast & stable development methodology for a team developers to use and share. It makes use of an MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern implemented with CFC's and using an event-driven model. I introduce the concept of event handler CFC's that hold all the code necessary to prepare views, call model CFC's, use plugins, and redirect requests through the ColdBox controller.
